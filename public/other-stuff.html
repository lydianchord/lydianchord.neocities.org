              I finally decided to finish reading Futaribeya now that Yukiko
              has started working on a new manga (Shirotae-sama, Himitsu desu
              yo). In a series with several canon lesbian couples among the
              side characters, it's great how you can tell how much Sakurako
              and Kasumi love each other as working adults who want to live
              together for the rest of their lives despite never explicitly
              declaring what kind of relationship they have.

            The anime adaptation of There's No Freaking Way I'll Be Your Lover!
            Unless... was animated surprisingly well. I suppose this is one of
            those yuri series where it's best to turn off your brain if you
            want to enjoy the story, but I'm glad they at least toned down some
            of the more questionable stuff.

              Yeah, I still don't find Lahabrea sympathetic, but I appreciated
              learning about his very slightly dysfunctional family through fun
              raids.

            I really liked the cast of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, especially Gwynn
            and whatever was going on with her and Canari. I still prefer
            turn-based battles over the new real-time system though. Yes, it's
            easy to reach rank A in online multiplayer, but getting sniped by a
            laggy Thunderbolt user from the other end of the map while you're
            struggling to lock onto the right target gets old after a while.

              The story and maps kind of felt all over the place, but it was nice
              to get closure on the main plot threads from the beginning of the
              game. FFV has my favorite soundtrack in the series, so I loved
              hearing the music every time I returned to the Baldesion Annex.

            I finally got around to playing the Sunbreak expansion for Monster
            Hunter Rise. I ended up turning on gyro controls for everything to
            deal with afflicted monsters zooming around everywhere since I've
            gotten so used to the controls in Splatoon. Still not a huge fan of
            how fast-paced everything is compared to older Monster Hunter games,
            but at least it's manageable now.

            The Apothecary Diaries is one of those shows I always enjoy watching
            when it's airing. I can't get enough of mystery series (loosely)
            based on historical settings.

            Gundam GQuuuuuuX was okay. It needed way more episodes to flesh out
            the characters for the alternate timeline it was attempting to
            depict. The music was great though.

              I was honestly a fan of the bizarre supernatural horror that

              A lot of yuri series kind of decline in quality or just end
              serialization after the main couple officially gets together, so
              I'm really glad Otherside Picnic is still continuing with most of
              the focus on Sorawo and Toriko, and the Otherside incidents are
              still as unsettling as ever. It's amusing how easily Sorawo shows
              her affection for Toriko now despite constantly agonizing over how
              to characterize their relationship.

            overview of the middle ages, mainly in Europe and the Middle East.
            It's a bit mind-boggling to think about how much of our modern world

            The everyday life of Mirai and Liko as roommates raising their
            magical daughter (and stopping another world-ending threat) in Witchy
            Pretty Cure Mirai Days was entertaining if short.

            Now that I'm off the free trial in FFXIV, the market board is
            actually pretty fun. It's kind of ridiculous what you can get away
            with by just going to different worlds for much better prices.

            The older maps in History of World Trade in Maps were neat to look
            at. It's interesting how common south-up maps used to be.

            Acro Trip was a silly, enjoyable magical girl show with some good
            (non-dark) twists.

            Season three of Love Live Superstar was a decent send-off for the
            third years. I still preferred when there were fewer members, even if
            I did like most of the newer characters.

              Stormblood was fine. Much more engaging than A Realm Reborn, at
              least. I did really enjoy the Omega raid fights even if they were
              mainly nostalgia bait.

            I like staring at maps, so The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient
            Rome was a fun read even though it had a number of typos in the
            dates and labels.
