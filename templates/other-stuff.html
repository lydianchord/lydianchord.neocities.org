          Now that I'm off the free trial in FFXIV, the market board is
          actually pretty fun. It's kind of ridiculous what you can get away
          with by just going to different worlds for much better prices.
        </li>
        <li>
          The older maps in History of World Trade in Maps were neat to look
          at. It's interesting how common south-up maps used to be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acro Trip was a silly, enjoyable magical girl show with some good
          (non-dark) twists.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season three of Love Live Superstar was a decent send-off for the
          third years. I still preferred when there were fewer members, even if
          I did like most of the newer characters.

          Stormblood was fine. Much more engaging than A Realm Reborn, at
          least. I did really enjoy the Omega raid fights even if they were
          mainly nostalgia bait.
        </li>
        <li>
          I like staring at maps, so The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient
          Rome was a fun read even though it had a number of typos in the
          dates and labels.
