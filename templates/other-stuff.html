  <h3>Thoughts</h3>

          Stormblood was fine. Much more engaging than A Realm Reborn, at
          least. I did really enjoy the Omega raid fights even if they were
          mainly nostalgia bait.
        </li>
        <li>
          I like staring at maps, so The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient
          Rome was a fun read even though it had a number of typos in the
          dates and labels.
